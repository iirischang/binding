		<h1>Words as Material</h1>
	</section>
	<p class="intro">I gave this talk at RISD in Providence and UXLx in Lisbon. Thanks to Tim Maly and Bruno Figueiredo
		for inviting
		me to speak, and to Allen Tan, Tina Lee, and Max Fenton for their thoughtful feedback on drafts.</p>
	<p>I want to start with a quote from writer, activist, and teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. In Being Peace, he writes:</p>
	<p class="mark-1">“</p>
	<section class="quotesection">
		<quote>If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in every sheet of paper. Without a
			cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper.
			The
			cloud is essential for the paper to exist.</quote>
	</section>
	<p class="mark-2">”</p>
	<p>Thich Nhat Hanh calls this concept interbeing. He goes on to say that the sun is also in the sheet of paper; and
		the lumberjack who cut down the tree; and his parents; and the wheat that made his morning bread; and so on. All
		of these things make it possible for the paper to exist.
	</p>
	<p>I bring up this story, because it helped me understand systems at a deeper level. I’ve been thinking a lot about
		what it takes to make a design project successful and even possible in the first place. I have a few hunches and
		I believe words play an important part in the process. But before I get to that, let’s look at how the paper
		metaphor relates to us as designers.</p>
	<section class="subtitle">
		<h2>01</h2>
		<h2>How design works</h2>
	</section>
	<p>Our work depends on many things: time, money, technology, materials, constraints, and most importantly, the
		lives, attention, and experiences of other people. We participate in and often orchestrate a process that’s
		bigger than we are. Design requires collaborators, contributors, customers, toolmakers, factory workers,
		marketers, postal workers, call center agents, you name it. If we look closely, we can see that people are at
		the heart of everything we make.</p>
	<p>When I started writing this talk, I asked my designer friends on Twitter to answer this question: What’s the
		number one thing that sabotages projects for you? Here are a few of their answers:</p>

	</section>
	<p>These problems boil down to one thing: communication. Sharing ideas with other people. Working through decisions
		together to make something new. We’re here to make meaningful changes in the world, but we can’t do that if we
		don’t understand each other. We can’t ignore people or work around them.</p>
	<p>we want design to communicate, we need to communicate in the design process.</p>
