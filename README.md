Hi, Iâ€™m Iris.
This is the third project for the [Typography & Interaction class (2024-2025)](https://typography-interaction-2425.github.io/). <br>
The project is based on three articles explore how designers navigate the relationship between design, text, and writing, as well as how to treat text as both visual and conceptual material. 
This project focused on exploring the relationship between typography and interaction with creating **HTML and CSS** to structure and style the webpage.<br>
