	</section>
			<p class="intro">I gave this talk at RISD in Providence and UXLx in Lisbon. Thanks to Tim Maly and Bruno Figueiredo
				for inviting
				me to speak, and to Allen Tan, Tina Lee, and Max Fenton for their thoughtful feedback on drafts.</p>
			<p>I want to start with a quote from writer, activist, and teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh. In Being Peace, he writes:</p>
			<p class="mark-1">“</p>
	<section class="quotesection">
		<quote>If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in every sheet of paper. Without a
			cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper.
			The cloud is essential for the paper to exist.</quote>
	</section>
			<p class="mark-2">”</p>
			<p>Thich Nhat Hanh calls this concept interbeing. He goes on to say that the sun is also in the sheet of paper; and
				the lumberjack who cut down the tree; and his parents; and the wheat that made his morning bread; and so on. All
				of these things make it possible for the paper to exist.
			</p>
			<p>I bring up this story, because it helped me understand systems at a deeper level. I’ve been thinking a lot about
				what it takes to make a design project successful and even possible in the first place. I have a few hunches and
				I believe words play an important part in the process. But before I get to that, let’s look at how the paper
				metaphor relates to us as designers.</p>

		<h2>How <br> design works</h2>
	</section>
			<p>Our work depends on many things: time, money, technology, materials, constraints, and most importantly, the
				lives, attention, and experiences of other people. We participate in and often orchestrate a process that’s
				bigger than we are. Design requires collaborators, contributors, customers, toolmakers, factory workers,
				marketers, postal workers, call center agents, you name it. If we look closely, we can see that people are at
				the heart of everything we make.</p>
			<p>When I started writing this talk, I asked my designer friends on Twitter to answer this question: What’s the
				number one thing that sabotages projects for you? Here are a few of their answers:</p>

			<p class="stickydown">These problems boil down to one thing: communication. Sharing ideas with other people. Working
				through decisions
				together to make something new. We’re here to make meaningful changes in the world, but we can’t do that if we
				don’t understand each other. We can’t ignore people or work around them.</p>
			<p>we want design to communicate, we need to communicate in the design process.</p>
	<section class="subtitle">
		<h2 class="subnumber">02</h2>
		<h2>How communication works</h2>
	</section>
			<p>So I’ve been thinking about what communication looks like in the design process. Here’s my take:</p>
	<h4 class="looks">Self</h4>
	<h4 class="looks">Team</h4>
	<h4 class="looks">Product</h4>
	<h4 class="looks">Public</h4>
	<h5>Self</h5>
			<p>We start by thinking alone. We may be collaborating with friends or colleagues, but we still need space to make
		sense of what we’re making. We have to put it into terms we can relate to.</p>
	<h5>Team</h5>
			<p>We also have to talk through it with our team. That’s where extroverted thinking comes in. We may need to sketch,
				or brainstorm ideas, or summarize what we’ve heard from interviews or user research. We have to get on the same
				page or find a shared language. Once we have a sense of what we’re doing, we can express those goals as
				requirements, come up with an approach, and move forward. All of these messy conversations help us gather
				consensus and work through the details.</p>
	<h5>Product</h5>
			<p>After choosing a design direction, we can prototype it, refine it, and try to make it speak for itself. The
				product needs to reflect the goals and intent we set out to achieve—and in some ways, it needs to stand on its
				own.</p>
	<h5>Public</h5>
			<p>Once we’re clear on what we’re making, we build it. And if we’re lucky, we get to announce it and share it with
				the world.</p>
			<p>As we move through each of these steps, the idea starts to solidify and become visible to people around us. This
				is why I think of design as a process of articulation. We join together to express an idea in a coherent form.
				We bring ideas to life. We connect the dots or build bridges for our users. That often means being specific
				about what a product does, who it’s for, why it matters, and how it works. We have to trek through a pile of
				ambiguity to do this.</p>
	<section class="subtitle-3">
		<h2 class="subnumber">03</h2>
		<h2>How writing<br>fits in</h2>
	</section>
			<p>This outward arc or continuum is the same one that I go through as a writer. I think and sketch and jot down
				notes; I question my assumptions; I struggle to understand. Later, when I have a sense of what I need to do, I
				share drafts and take in feedback; I try different variations and keep refining the work until it’s ready for
				the public.</p>
			<p>I work on digital products and physical goods, so I’m deeply involved in the design process. But I also want to
				call out early that my process is the design process. I don’t write fiction or short stories; I use language to
				solve problems—whether that’s behind the scenes or in the product itself. I use words as material.</p>
			<p>Earlier this year, Matt Jones gave a talk at Interaction15 about his experience running BERG and directing
				interaction design at Google’s Creative Lab. He said:</p>
			<p class="mark-1">“</p>
	<section class="quotesection">
		<quote>" Writers " are the fastest designers in the world. They’re amazing at boiling down incredibly abstract
			concepts into tiny packets of cognition, or language.</quote>
	</section>
			<p class="mark-2">”</p>
			<p>Going back to Thich Nhat Hanh, I believe that writing is part of every design. If you can clearly define what
				you’re making and articulate its value, the steps to bring it out into the world will go much faster. It’s easy
				to put pixels together when you’ve already made decisions. And since we work across systems and borders, there’s
				no better way to articulate design than with writing.</p>
	<section class="subtitle">
		<h2 class="subnumber">04</h2>
		<h2>The gap<br>between us</h2>
	</section>
			<p>I want to focus on writing today, because I’ve noticed a huge gap between writers and designers in the
				professional world. And I think it contributes to the larger communication problems we face. We’re often on
				separate teams in separate buildings. We have the same goals and audiences, but we’re rarely seen as partners or
				equals.</p>
			<p>I first noticed this gap 10 years ago when I was working at Apple, and I’ve seen it again and again since.
				Designers are invited to product meetings; writers hear about them afterwards. Designers sit close to the CEO;
				writers are in the call center or brought in right before the launch. Designers make things; writers support
				them. You can probably trace this separation back to how we’re taught in grade school or high school. In the
				U.S. at least, we learn to write in English class, to draw in art class, and to understand shapes and numbers in
				math class. But I’ve realized this intentional separation weakens our work and limits the contributions we can
				make to the world.</p>
			<p>When I’m on a team, I always try to sit with the designers and engineers—whether in person or on IRC. But most
				product teams don’t even have a writer. And unfortunately, I don’t think I can solve this particular problem
				myself. So instead of trying to restructure every product team out there, I’ve been thinking about how you can
				use words as material in your own design practice.</p>
			<p>These are some of the questions that have come up for me along the way:</p>
	<section>
		<h6>What does writing contribute to the design process?</h6>
		<h6 class="h6-2">How can designers use words to articulate what they’re making?</h6>
		<h6>How can we, as humans, benefit from clear language?</h6>
		<h6 class="h6-2">How can writing make products easier to adopt and understand?</h6>
		<h6>How can I broaden the definition of “writing” for designers?</h6>
	</section>
			<p>I keep using that phrase “words as material,” so let’s talk about words for a bit.</p>
	<section class="subtitle">
		<h2 class="subnumber">05</h2>
		<h2>What are <br>words for</h2>
	</section>
			<p>Words shape our ideas, how we see the world, and how we relate to one another. As design teacher and researcher
				Anne Galloway says:</p>
			<p class="mark-1">“</p>
	<section class="quotesection">
		<quote>Language doesn’t just make things—it assembles, cobbles together, entire worlds and all the relations
			within.</quote>
	</section>
			<p class="mark-2">”</p>
			<p>Language makes it possible for us to navigate places and relationships; to express needs and requirements; to
				name and categorize things; and to understand our place in the universe.</p>
			<p>Last year, I had the pleasure of editing Abby Covert’s marvelous book about information architecture, How to Make
				Sense of Any Mess. In it, she says:</p>
			<p class="mark-1">“</p>
	<section class="quotesection">
		<quote>Language is the material of intent… Language is how we tell other people what we want, what we expect of
			them, and what we hope to accomplish together. Without language, we can’t collaborate.</quote>
	</section>
			<p class="mark-2">”</p>
			<p>Without words, we wouldn’t be able to plan or effect change.</p>
			<p>As a technology, writing has many merits. It complements verbal and visual communication. It’s sturdy and can
				stay put. It’s cheap. It’s easy to change or reproduce. And it moves faster than ships or airplanes. Writing
				makes it possible to propel knowledge and intent forward through time.</p>
			<p>Historically, writing has served us as a force of stability. It gave us a way to record history, exchange
				information, and establish legal systems. We wrote to preserve knowledge, transmit ideas, and pass on
				traditions. And of course, we still do those things, even with hypertext. We still treat writing as a product of
				the editorial process.</p>
	<section class="subtitle">
		<h2 class="subnumber">06</h2>
		<h2>Understand and clarify the problem</h2>
	</section>
			<p>But I’ve also come to see writing as a material in itself. Something we can play with and manipulate. Something
				that can change over time as questions come up in the design process or an idea evolves. Writing can be a tool
				for talking to ourselves when we’re still figuring things out. A sort of mirror or feedback system. A way to
				understand and articulate design.</p>
			<p>When we put ideas down into words, we give them form and make them malleable. We bring them out into the light
				and make them visible to other people. And that’s super important, because we can’t read each other’s minds. We
				need to be able to examine what we think we know, question it as a group, and refine it. That’s the only way we
				can get closer to the truth together.</p>
			<p>Writers sometimes talk about this idea of casting a sentence. You throw a line out there and see if it catches.
				And if it doesn’t ring true, you reel it back in and keep trying. You may use the same words in a different
				order, swap them out for synonyms, or start over completely. It’s kind of like sketching with words.</p>
			<p>When I sit down to write, I don’t usually know what I’m going to say. It’s only through the act of writing that
				it becomes clear that I need to say anything at all.</p>
			<p>If you want to use words as material, I highly encourage you to see them as small blocks and modules you can play
				with. Write down the words your clients or colleagues use on index cards or sticky notes. Move them around. See
				how they stack and relate to each other. If clear writing is clear thinking, we have to be willing to get messy
				first. Anne Lamott talks about this in her classic book, Bird by Bird. She says:</p>
	<p class="mark-1">“</p>
	<section class="quotesection">
		<quote>What people somehow (inadvertently, I’m sure) forgot to mention when we were children was that we need to
		make messes in order to find out who we are and why we are here—and, by extension, what we’re supposed to be
		writing.

		<h2>More people, <br>more problems</h2>
	</section>
			<p>Let’s go back to those communication problems we talked about. I’ll focus on these four in particular:</p>
	<section class="problems">
			<p class="problem">No product vision</p>
			<p class="problem">Different goals and expectations</p>
	</section>
	<section class="problems-2">
			<p class="problem">Oversimplifying the problem or solution</p>
			<p class="problem">Design doesn’t sell itself</p>
	</section>
			<p>I want to share how I use words as material to move the design process forward. I hope these techniques make your
				life a little easier, whether you’re helping a client make decisions or making them yourself. (As an aside,
				whenever I use the word “client,” that could be a product lead or someone you work with. Whoever’s in charge of
				the product vision.)</p>
		<h5>1. No product vision</h5>
			<p>Conflicting ideas are one thing—but it’s even harder to talk about an idea when there is no idea. I’m selfishly starting with this one, because I’ve seen it a lot in the past few years.
			</p>
			<p>The client may be making a product or a website, but they don’t have a picture in mind of what it should be. Maybe they haven’t taken the time to daydream about it. They may be in reaction mode, or they may need help asking deeper questions about their values or intent, like where their business is going, or why they’re in business in the first place. I generally see this as a lack of leadership, but it can also be a lack of connection and team identity. Some people who work together don’t really have a bond or a shared purpose, and that can slow down the design process.
			</p>
			<p>There are a few ways you can work through this. I start every project with a set of questions. I like food metaphors, so I call them Starter Questions, like an appetizer. These questions help me understand the client’s needs and vocabulary. I write down words they say and I reflect them back when it’s appropriate. I also dig deeper when people use empty words like “simple” or “user-friendly.” Those words don’t help you as a designer. When one person says “innovative,” they may be talking about how it looks or behaves. And when another person says it, they may be talking about the business model or the process that a user goes through.
			</p>
			<p>Words are squishy and subjective. But if you take the time to build a shared language, that will help you when you’re presenting design directions. You can find some of the questions I ask in my Tiny Content Framework on GitHub.
			</p>
			<p>Another thing you can do to help your client think through outcomes is to show them examples from competitors and teams outside their industry. Get them to talk about what they like and don’t like. Their taste is less important than their word choice. How do they react to things? Also pay attention to words they don’t say. Sometimes codifying your vocabulary is enough to steer you in the right direction.
			</p>
			<p>There’s a common technique of writing a press release in the early stages of product design. The exercise is supposed to help you narrow down features and requirements and get you thinking about the product narrative. Etsy’s design director, Randy J. Hunt, calls this the “who, what, when, where, why, and how of your product.”
			</p>
			<p>I do something similar, but I start even earlier and I make it more personal. I don’t talk to the press, so I find that exercise tricky in practice. Instead, I like to write letters to people that I know.
			</p>
			<p>As a recent example, I’m working on an idea for a second book—an essay collection I want to edit and design. I started writing down the vision for the book by telling my friend Rachel about it in a letter.
			</p>
		<article class="letter">
			Hi Rachel,
			Thanks so much for offering to give me feedback on my project! So, here goes. I’m working on a collection of stories from writers who’ve been through. . .
		</article>
			<p>I told her what I was hoping to accomplish with the project, included examples of essays that might be in the book, and talked about the audience I want to reach. I didn’t actually send it to her (sorry, Rachel!), but the exercise helped me get started on my proposal. I went on to use the basis of that letter to invite early contributors to the project and reach out to agents. And I’ll use a very similar outline when I do a formal call for contributors.</p>
		<article class="letter">
			Hi Jane,
			I’m working on a collection of stories from writers who’ve been through XXXXXX. I came across your piece in The Rumpus and wondered if you’d be interested in contributing to the project. . .
		</article>
			<p>As you start to externalize your idea, it’s not enough to imagine a good outcome or define why it matters. You also have to articulate your goals so people can rally around them. That brings me to another communication problem: conflicting goals and expectations.</p>
		<h5>2. Different goals and expectations</h5>
			<p>Jean-Paul Sartre is known for saying, “L’enfer, c’est les autres.” But my friend Frank Chimero says, “Hell is other people’s undocumented assumptions.”</p>
			<p>Gaps in expectations are especially tricky when your client has a different take on things. It only gets worse as you move out from there. Maybe the client is rushing you, or they haven’t given you enough information. Maybe some of your team members don’t like each other, or aren’t used to collaborating. This kind of unresolved internal confusion is a problem. It’s not necessarily your fault, but it can make things difficult.</p>
			<p>If the gap is between people on your team, get them to talk to each other. Do a journey mapping exercise to walk through concrete steps users can take. Or interview them individually, and summarize the different perspectives you heard from your team. Whenever there’s a lack of clarity or agreement, questions are your biggest strategic tool.</p>
			<p>Trust the weirdness of the process. When I’m working with writers, I like to use a metaphor of putting a puzzle together. You have to get all of the ideas on the table before you worry about how they connect, or which ones to cut. If you try to synthesize too early, you’ll leave someone out that’s important to the process and have to go back and have more conversations.
			</p>
			<p>This problem can also crop up with the public. If there’s a gap between what the product team is making and what the marketing team is selling, you’re making false promises. You can help solve this by encouraging marketers to be honest and realistic about what your product does—and by clearly defining features and expectations with them early. Otherwise, they’re just going to make things up.</p>
			<p>There’s another problem in there of telling the right story. If your team doesn’t agree on why the product is interesting, it’s going to be hard to market it. You can solve this perception problem in a couple of ways.</p>
			<p>Card sorting exercises are useful for narrowing things down. I often do card sorts with my clients to get them to choose brand attributes or requirements. You can do a similar exercise by asking your team to choose and rank marketing messages. This is especially useful on teams of 10 or more people.</p>
			<p>I’ve been known to write multiple choice questions and quiz product managers. Here’s an example from a couple of years ago. Safari is a digital reading service for web professionals.</p>
